# Substitute Middle Mouse Button

* The ' ` ' key mimics the middle mouse button
* Pressing left-control + ' ` ' closes the program. A dialog confirms that the program closed.
* The program only functions when common CAD software is being used. If you press keys too many times outside of CAD software
then the program will close. The assumption is that the program was
forgotten and left active by accident.

On the first day of graphics class, I realized that the middle mouse button was **really** important
for using Solid Edge. My mouse didn't have one. Rather than driving to the store and buying a different mouse, I decided
to make a program that runs in the background and maps an unused keyboard button to the middle mouse button instead.
