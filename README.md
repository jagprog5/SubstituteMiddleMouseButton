# Substitute Middle Mouse Button

On the first day of graphics class, I realized that the middle mouse button was **really** important
for using Solid Edge (CAD software). My mouse didn't have one. Rather than driving to the store and buying a different mouse, I decided
to make a program that runs in the background and maps an unused keyboard button to the middle mouse button instead.

Here's how to use it:

* The ' ` ' key mimics the middle mouse button
* Pressing left-control + ' ` ' closes the program. A dialog confirms that the program closed.
* The program only functions when Solid Edge is being used. If you press keys too many times outside of Solid Edge
then the program will also close. The assumption is that the program was
forgotten and left active by accident.
